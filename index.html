                    <span class="text">Macbeth is the title character of the play which means that his name is also the name of the play and he along with his friend Banquo are generals in the army of king Duncan. While returning from a battle they run into a group of witches in a bog who tell Macbeth that he will be the Thane of Cawdor and later king of Scotland. Banquo is told that he will not be king of Scotland but that his descendants will be. Because of this rather good news they are keen to find out more details but annoyingly the witches disappear. Not long afterwards Macbeth actually does get promoted to thane of Cawdor which makes him think that the witches may have been onto something. On top of that good fortune king Duncan also plans to honor macbeth with a visit to his castle in Inverness. Macbeth promptly writes home to tell his wife Lady Macbeth about his new position and also about the strange encounter with the witch. Now unfortunately Lady Macbeth happens to be far more ruthless than her husband so she is immediately determined to help him fulfill his destiny by whatever wicked means necessary.</span>

                    <span class="text">When the king arrives at macbeth's castle lady macbeth is quick to suggest that they use this opportunity to murder him. Macbeth is hesitant but agrees after a lot of pressure from his wife. She does her bit by sedating the guards with spiked wine but leaves Macbeth to do the dirty work of actually killing Duncan. As any normal person would Macbeth is overcome with guilt at what he has done but Lady Macbeth sets him straight by berating him for his cowardice. She then frames the poor guards with the daggers covered in the king's blood. At this critical moment the nobleman Macduff decides to turn up at their gates unexpectedly so after a bit of frantic running around they make a great show of finding the king's corpse and executing the unlucky guards. Guessing quite rightly that whoever has killed their father is bound to come after them next the dead king's sons Malcolm and Donalbain managed to escape the castle and Macbeth's murderous grasp.</span>

                    <span class="text">Now that Duncan is dead or rather murdered Macbeth is crowned king of Scotland and the witches prophecy comes true. However his pesky conscience keeps him from enjoying his success as he is plagued by paranoia. His biggest worry is that his friend Banquo has a son Fleance and the witches did mention that Banquo's descendants would be kings. To rectify this Macbeth puts a hit out on the two unsuspecting men and Banquo is murdered but Fleance is able to escape. Plunged even further into his pit of guilt, Macbeth sees the ghost of Banquo at a banquet that night and is scared nearly out of his mind causing Lady Macbeth to begin to have a few doubts of her own.</span>

                    <span class="text">To calm himself down after these traumatic incidents Macbeth decides to return to the source of these events the mysterious witches. They reassure him that no harm will come to him unless Burnham Wood, the surrounding forest, marches to fight him. Even better no man born of a woman will be able to defeat him. These two statements at the time were the equivalent of saying when pigs fly so Macbeth is suitably calmed. However the witches reiterate that banquo's descendants will still be king which puts Macbeth into a state again. He goes on a murderous rampage killing all those associated with the opposition including Macduff's family but not Macduff as he had joined up with Malcolm and Donalbain to fight against Macbeth.</span>

                <div class="content">
                    <span class="text">Holed up in his castle at Dunsinane, Macbeth is shocked to learn that Burnham Wood from the witch's prophecy appears to be marching towards him. Malcolm's army cleverly cut down branches from the trees and held them in front as camouflage to create this illusion. Adding to Macbeth's misery is the news that Lady Macbeth has taken her own life after being tormented by sleepwalking and visions of blood on her hands that cannot be cleaned. Macbeth and his army are on the verge of defeat but there is one last glimmer of hope given to him by the witches, no man born of a woman can kill him. Armed with this prophecy he accepts a challenge from Macduff only to learn mid-battle that Macduff was born via c-section, so technically he is not born of a woman. Realizing that the witches had craftily foretold his doom rather than assure him of security Macbeth is defeated and Mcduff takes his head to Malcolm who ends the play promising peace and going off to a city called "Scone" to be crowned the new king of Scotland.</span>
